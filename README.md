Changing precipitation patterns and increasing human reliance on groundwater resources drive changes in streamflow patterns and persistence. 
While streamflow depletion has wide-ranging effects for aquatic ecosystems and human populations, detecting and predicting the impacts of
streamflow depletion can be very difficult. Several low-flow metrics have been used in management to assess potential impacts of groundwater
withdrawals on streamflow, but the ecohydrological indicators most sensitive to groundwater withdrawals have not yet been identified. The code 
and data included in this repository constitute a comprehensive exploration of how stream hydrographs and thermographs respond to 
groundwater withdrawals, as measured by a suite of ecohydrological indicators. For a full description of methods and results, see
