We are using this to investigate the typical distance between wells and the closest stream. Data are only available for
a handful of states, as described below.

- Pertaining to the dataset "Montana.csv": We credit the Ground Water Information Center at the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology for providing access to the original well completion dataset that these data derive from.
- Pertaining to the dataset "Nevada.csv": By request of the Nevada Division of Water Resources' Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, we provide the following "Disclaimer of warranties/accuracy of data" that applies to the dataset: "Although the data found using The Division of Water Resources' systems have been produced and processed from sources believed to be reliable, no warranty expressed or implied is made regarding accuracy, adequacy, completeness, legality, reliability or usefulness of any information. This disclaimer applies to both isolated and aggregate uses of the information. The Division of Water Resources' provides this information on an "as is" basis. All warranties of any kind express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, freedom from contamination by computer viruses and non-infringement of proprietary rights ARE DISCLAIMED. Changes may be periodically added to the information herein; these changes may or may not be incorporated in any new version of the publication. If you have obtained information from The Division of Water Resources' from a source other than The Division of Water Resources' Home Page, be aware that electronic data can be altered subsequent to original distribution. Data can also quickly become out-of-date. It is recommended that careful attention be paid to the contents of any metadata associated with a file, and that the originator of the data or information be contacted with any questions regarding appropriate use. If you find any errors or omissions, we encourage you to report them to the Division of Water Resources Webmaster."
- Pertaining to the dataset "Oklahoma.csv": By request of the Oklahoma Water Resources Board we provide the following "description of the well logs that is included in the metadata": "The well locations depicted in this GIS coverage are those recorded on the Multi-Purpose Well Completion Reports filed by licensed well drillers for each new well constructed. The well locations are usually described to a quarter, quarter, quarter of a section (ten-acre tract); however, older well completion reports did not require the driller to provide as complete a description and those locations may describe a 640, 160 or 40 acre tract.  A latitude/longitude coordinate was derived for the legal description by using a conversion program called "Okie-Loc" developed by Geo Information Systems at the University of Oklahoma. This conversion program provides the center of the described tract as the location for the well even though the well may actually be located any place within the tract. Most locations have not been field verified; however, in a few cases, the coordinates of the well location were determined by using a global positioning system (GPS), which would provide a more accurate point location. The coverage is updated monthly." We also provide a "general disclaimer that is included in OWRB metadata files": "The data represent the results of data collection and/or processing for the specific OWRB activity or purpose described above.  As such, the data are valid only for their use, content, time, and accuracy specifications determined or intended by, or acceptable to, the OWRB.  These data are not guaranteed to be useable, timely, accurate, or complete.  The user is responsible for any use of these data other than their use by the OWRB, and for the results of any application of the data for other than the purpose intended by the OWRB.

Users are cautioned to consider carefully the provisional nature of these data and information before using them for decisions that concern personal or public safety or the conduct of business that involves substantial monetary or operational consequences."
- Pertaining to the dataset "Texas.csv": By request of the Texas Water Development Board we note that the data were downloaded April 22, 2016 and that provide the following disclaimer "ask that you include the following disclaimer: SDR DISCLAIMER:  The Submitted Drillers Report (SDR) Database (http://www.twdb.texas.gov/groundwater/data/drillersdb.asp) is populated from the online Texas Well Report Submission and Retrieval System (TWRSRS) which is a cooperative Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) and Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) application that registered water-well drillers use to submit their required reports. This system was started 2/5/2001 and began collecting all reports in 2003. Reports that drillers submitted by mail before the inception date are not included in this database, but are available for access at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Water Well Report Viewer: (http://www.tceq.texas.gov/gis/waterwellview.html).  Be aware that the locations of the wells in this database are not verified by State staff and may be inaccurate.  Added Proposed Use: Fracking Supply in February 2011."

Descriptions of each field in the .csv file:
"COMID" - nearest 30m-resolution NHD flowline code
"siteID" - code we created that provides a unique number for each well in the database
"WellWaterDepth_m" - the recorded depth of water in the well (units: meters)
"NearestFlowlineDistance_m" - the calculated distance from the well to the nearest National Hydrography Dataset flowline (units: meters)
"NearStreamPtNED30mElv_masl" - the elevation recorded by the National Elevation Dataset at the nearest point on the nearest National Hydrography Dataset flowline to each well (i.e., the elevation at the latitude-longitude pairing of the nearest stream for each well; units: meters above sea level) 
"BankHeight_m" - the estimated "Bankfull Height" for the nearest National Hydrography Dataset flowline
"WellDepth_m" - the recorded depth of the well (units: meters)
"Width_m" - the estimated width of the surface water feature closest to the well (units: meters)
"latitude" - recorded latitude of well (units: decimal degrees)
"longitude" - recorded longitude of well (units: decimal degrees)
"Date" - decimal date for completion record* ["-1" values denote a well completion record where the date was not specified or deemed implausible (e.g., erroneous enter postdating the date the data were downloaded)]
"WellNED30mElv_masl" - the elevation of the land surface at the location (i.e., latitude, longitude) of the well (units: meters above sea level) recorded by the National Elevation Dataset
"bank_corrected_head_difference_m" - the calculated difference between the elevation of the well water and the elevation of the nearest stream surface (units: meters; calculated as: ["WellNED30mElv_masl"] minus ["WellWaterDepth_m"] minus ["NearStreamPtNED30mElv_masl"] plus ["BankHeight_m"])
